# PyChronoBoost

Automated Time Series Feature Engineering

PyChronoBoost is a utility Python package designed for time series data analysis and forecasting. It offers robust functionality for imputing missing values, generating and selecting features, and handling various complexities associated with time series data.

## Features

- **Time Series Imputation**: Efficiently handles missing data in time series, both in terms of values and time steps.
- **Feature Generation**: Automatic generation of relevant features from time series data.
- **Feature Selection**: Utilizes algorithms like XGBoost to select the most significant features for your analysis.

## Installation

Install PyChronoBoost using pip:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/jimmyyih518/PyChronoBoost
```

## Quick Start

Here's a quick example to get you started with PyChronoBoost:
```
import pandas as pd
from pychronoboost.timeseries import TimeSeriesData

# Sample time series data
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'time': pd.date_range(start='2021-01-01', periods=5, freq='D'),
    'value': [1, None, 3, 4, 5]
})

# Initialize TimeSeriesData object
ts_data = TimeSeriesData(data, timestep_column='time')

# Process features
processed_data = ts_data.process_timeseries_features(
    feature_columns=['value'],
    target_column='value',
    value_impute_strategy='last',
    max_window_size=3,
    feature_selector_model='XGB',
    max_features=5
)

print(processed_data)

```
